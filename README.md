## Tableau Gas Stations Experiments

This is the supporting code for my blog post on [GIS and Spatial Joins in Tableau on Quandary]().

## Getting The Data
You will need to create a `data` directory.  Then, grab the relevant files drop them into the directory, and unzip them.

## Relevant Files
* [Community Planning Boundaries Shapefile on DataSD](http://data.sandiego.gov/dataset/community-planning-district-boundaries)
* [Shapefile of Gas Stations from SanGIS](http://mrm-screen.s3.amazonaws.com/Gas_Stations.zip)
